Hi,

How did you figure it out that there is a 4066 IC on this project 
https://core-electronics.com.au/projects/p0wer-control-mains-outlets-over-wifi

The IC mark is blanked I only see those 14 pins :D

You can reply on geoagr2003@gmail.com or on this file.

Can you provide me some tips or tutorial or how can I read those CMOS. 
I have the same kind of outlets with 2 remote controls and I would like to put the same codes in both remotes.

Regards,

George
